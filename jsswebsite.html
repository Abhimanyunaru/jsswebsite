					<p><img src="jss maha.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:30%;height:30%;">The origin of JSS Mahavidyapeetha (JSSMVP), a formidable educational movement, can be traced to the establishment of a small hostel in 1928 to cater to the accommodation needs of students pursuing higher studies in Mysore. His Holiness Jagadguru Dr. Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji established the Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahavidyapeetha (JSSMVP) in 1954 and it was registered under the Societies’ Registration Act 1960.<br>

						Focusing on a purpose as expansive and yet as specific as improving quality of life through Human Development, the JSS Mahavidyapeetha has grown from strength to strength. A long and healthy life, Education for all and a decent standard of living, the indicators of Human development, have been the underlying philosophy of Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Mahasamsthana Math, Suttur Srikshethra, for centuries. This is also the philosophy for which the Mahaidyapeetha today stands for.<br>\
